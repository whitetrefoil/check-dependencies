Check Dependencies
=====================================================

A simple lib to check node / npm / package dependencies.

I create this for myself to ensure all teammates will upgrade their node / npm packages during development.

Important
---------

1. This module is designed to be used in browsers only.
2. If your code isn't targeting the latest syntax spec of JS / ES,
please use something like babel to transfer this library.
